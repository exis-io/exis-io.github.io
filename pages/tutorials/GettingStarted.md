# Tutorials

Tutorials for Exis development. 

## Getting Started

Here are a series of tutorials developed around using Exis in different environments:

* [iOS][tutorial-helloswift]
* [Ionic][tutorial-helloionic]

<!--
### Riffle Libraries

Applications that communicate over the fabric require the Riffle client libraries. They're all hosted together on [github](https://github.com/exis-io/Exis). You can also head straight to the language of your choice:

* [iOS](https://github.com/exis-io/Exis/tree/master/ios)
* [Python](https://github.com/exis-io/pyRiffle)
* [Javascript](https://github.com/exis-io/Exis/tree/master/js)
* [Go](https://github.com/exis-io/core)

Each of the links above include instructions on how to install riffle into your own projects. For platforms that are a little more complicated you can download preconfigured projects.


## Creating a new App

You control the way you interact with Exis through a web interface. This includes creating applications, setting security details, and adding appliances to your applications. 

Head over to [my.exis.io](http://my.exis.io), sign up for an account, and log in.

Navigate to the dashboard and create a new application. The name you choose here will become part of your [domain][domains]. These screenshots show how to make an app for the Cards Against Humanity tutorial: change the app name as needed.

Once the app is created, you can attach *appliances*, or cloud services. You'll almost always need the *Auth* appliance, since it keeps track of your users.
