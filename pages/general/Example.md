# Examples of exis-code tags

There are several ways to use the exis-code tagging system.

Here is how Python looks for a simple publish call:
<exis-code lang="python" name="Pub/Sub Basic" action="publish"></exis-code>

Here is a missing code name
<exis-code lang="python" name="Missing" action="publish"></exis-code>

What basic pub/sub looks like for all languages
<exis-code name="Pub/Sub Basic"></exis-code>

Here is what the Python Racey code looks like
<exis-code lang="python" name="Pub/Sub OOO Racey"></exis-code>

Here is that publish call what it looks like if no language is specified but an action is specified:
<exis-code name="Pub/Sub Basic" action="publish"></exis-code>
