# Testing Content 

This is here for the purposes of testing UI content. This page is not listed. 

Playing around with the cookbook idea. 

### Header

This replaces the content with a directive. I'd like to transform a list of cookbook content into a [tabbed list menu.](https://codyhouse.co/gem/responsive-tabbed-navigation/)

<div polyglot-tab>
```swift
asda
```
```java
asdfasdf
```
```python
print "asdf"
```
</div>
