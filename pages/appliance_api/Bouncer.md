Bouncer
-------

Bouncer is a core appliance that manages permissions and roles across the
fabric and responds to queries regarding authorization to perform an
action.

Users may make calls to Bouncer to grant and revoke permissions for
endpoints which they control.

### addDynamicRole(role, appname, perms=None)

Add a dynamic role.

#### Parameters:
 - role (string) -- the unique identifier for the role within the domain appname
 - appname (string) -- the domain of the appname associated with the role
 - perms (list of dictionaries) -- a list of dicts with fully qualified targets in 'target' with $ syntax and an optional verb associated with it in 'verb' which can be called by members of the role i.e. {'target': xs.demo.nick.app/room/$/join, 'verb': 'c'} will add the rule with the $ replaced by the id of dynamicRole when instantiated [default: None]

**Return type:** boolean

### addSpecialAgent(domain, agent)

Give special agent privilege to an agent under an entire domain.  The
agent will be able to call, register, publish, and subscribe to all
endpoints at or below the given domain.

Use this feature carefully, as special agents may be able to perform
destructive operations.

#### Parameters:
 - domain (string) -- domain under which agent can access any endpoint
 - agent (string) -- domain of special agent

**Return type:** boolean

### addStaticRole(role, appname, perms=None, agents=None)

Add a static role into the database.  A role holds a list of permissions
that can then be assigned to agents.

Using roles instead of individual permissions is both intuitive and
good practice.  Example: all users can call x(); Nick and Mike are
users.  Later on, you can add a function y(), add it to the user role,
and it will automatically apply to Nick and Mike.

Returns: True if role was created

Raises: Exception describing failure

#### Parameters:
 - role (string) -- the unique identifier for the role within the domain appname
 - appname (string) -- the domain of the appname associated with the role
 - perms (list of dictionaries) -- a list of dicts with fully qualified targets in 'target', and a verb associated with it in 'verb' which can be called by members of the role [default: None]
 - agents (list of strings) -- a list of agents to assign the role to [default: None]

**Return type:** boolean
