Auth
----

The Auth appliance handles domain registrations and login credentials.  It
allows other users to log in and use your app and manages the secure
storage and transfer of their credentials.

Most of the work that Auth does is hidden behind the scenes, but you can
make requests to Auth to generate custom login tokens that allow you to
connect your code to the fabric while developing on your local machine.
